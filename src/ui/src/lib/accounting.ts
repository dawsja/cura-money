/**
 * Account / money accounting helpers.
 *
 * Sign convention (server-side enforced — see `upsertAccount` in
 * `src/db/queries.ts` and `Math.abs(parsedBalance)` in `src/lib/simplefin.ts`):
 *
 *   - All account balances are stored as POSITIVE numbers in the DB.
 *   - The account's `type` decides whether it contributes to net worth as
 *     an asset (+) or a liability (−):
 *
 *       assets     : checking, savings, investment
 *       liabilities: credit, loan
 *
 *   - When you need net worth, sum the *signed* contribution of each
 *     account. When you need to display a balance to the user, prefix
 *     liabilities with a `−` and color them rose so the UI doesn't
 *     mislead the user into thinking their debt is an asset.
 *
 * This file exists so the convention is encoded in ONE place — every
 * page that does net-worth math or shows a balance to the user should
 * import from here.
